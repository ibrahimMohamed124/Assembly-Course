# Assembly Basics 🧩

A beginner-friendly repository for learning **x86 Assembly Language** and understanding how high-level code maps to low-level machine instructions.  
This project focuses on **core CPU concepts**, **instruction behavior**, and foundations useful for **reverse engineering**.

---

## 📌 What You’ll Learn
- x86 Assembly syntax and structure
- CPU registers and memory addressing
- Stack behavior (push / pop / call / ret)
- Loops, conditions, and jumps
- Function calls and stack frames
- Calling conventions (32-bit & 64-bit)
- How C code translates into x86 Assembly
- Reading and understanding disassembly
